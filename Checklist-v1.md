# Fine-Tuning Large Language Model Checklist

## Setup
- [ ] Install necessary libraries and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- [ ] Set up Gemini AI platform and tools.

## Data Preparation
- [ ] Format training data correctly.
- [ ] Ensure sufficient examples for effective fine-tuning.

## Model Selection
- [ ] Choose base model to fine-tune (e.g., GPT, BERT).

## Fine-Tuning Configuration
- [ ] Define hyperparameters (e.g., batch size, learning rate).
- [ ] Set other relevant settings (consult Gemini AI documentation).

## Training
- [ ] Start fine-tuning process using Gemini AI platform.
- [ ] Monitor progress and adjust settings as needed.

## Evaluation
- [ ] Evaluate fine-tuned model using validation data.
- [ ] Ensure model performs well on task.

## Deployment
- [ ] Deploy fine-tuned model for use in applications.
